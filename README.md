# Pantheon Backend Engineer Assignment

## Setting up

### Configuration

The application expects the following configuration to be made available as environment variables, or through usage of a dotenv (`.env`) file.

```
UNSPLASH_APP_ID=<UNSPLASH APP ID>
UNSPLASH_ACCESS=<UNSPLASH ACCESS CODE>
UNSPLASH_SECRET=<UNSPLASH SECRET CODE>

PIXABAY_KEY=<PIXABAY KEY>

STORYBLOCKS_PUBLIC=<STORYBLOCKS PUBLIC KEY>
STORYBLOCKS_PRIVATE=<STORYBLOCKS PRIVATE KEY>

DATABASE=./database.sqlite
CACHE_RESULT=True

JWT_SECRET=<JWT SECRET KEY>
```

### Setting up with Docker

A docker image is made available at `ghcr.io/jeffrey04/pantheon-assignment:dev`, or you can proceed to build with

```
podman build -t jeffrey04/pantheon-assignment:dev ./podman
```

You can refer to the `docker-compose.yml.sample` to create a compose file for your environment. Please note that the database will reset itself on every run.


## Usage Guide

### Authentication

Register yourself through `POST /register` with the following fields passed to the body as JSON serialized object

* `name`: Your user name
* `password`: Your password

In return you will get an object with the following fields

* `name`: Your user name
* `token`: The JWT token you need to pass through the `Authorization` header for search requests


### Search

In order to authenticate yourself, you need to pass an `Authorization` header as follows

`Authorization: Bearer <YOUR TOKEN>`

Please refer to the previous section to register yourself to get a token.

Search is served via the endpoint `GET /search`. The endpoint expects a query string parameter named `search_term` where the value is a string containing the desired query.


## Experiment with 1000 requests

Not trying to fulfill the goal, just tested out of curiosity. Due to the API limit, I cheated by caching the result before running the test. 6 worker processes were spawned for the test.
